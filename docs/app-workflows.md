# App Workflows

User journeys inside the application.

## Ingest a Document (primary journey)

- User navigates to `/documents` — the Corpus library, scoped to the app's own
  `corpus/` prefix (distinct from the full-bucket `/files` Explorer)
- Clicks **Add Document** → a dialog with a dropzone (accepts PDF, DOCX, PPTX,
  HTML, MD, TXT — one file at a time) and an ingestion-config form
- The config fields are **selectors, not free text**: Export format (Markdown /
  JSON / HTML / Text), Max tokens per chunk (256 / 512 / 1024), and a Merge-peers
  switch. Safe-default guidance appears as field descriptions on the create form
  (e.g. "512 tokens + Markdown export suits most PDFs") — guidance only, no autofill
- On submit: the raw source streams to B2 (progress bar) and a `manifest.json` is
  written with `status: pending`. The document appears in the list
- User clicks **Ingest** on the row (or detail). The API reads the raw bytes back
  from B2, runs Docling (`DocumentConverter` + `HybridChunker`), and writes
  `parsed.md` + `chunks.jsonl` next to the source, then marks the manifest
  `ingested`. The first ingest downloads Docling's models (~500 MB–1 GB) and can
  take a while; the toast says so
- User opens the document (`/documents/[id]`): a Raw / Parsed / Chunks tabbed view
  with the raw preview (presigned inline iframe), the rendered parsed Markdown
  (tables paint via react-markdown + remark-gfm), a chunk browser, and the
  write-amplification stat (raw → derived bytes, ratio)
- **Edit config**: opens pre-filled from the stored config. Saving updates the
  manifest's config but does **not** re-run; the next Ingest uses it. (A source
  doc's bytes are immutable, so "edit" edits the ingestion config)
- **Re-ingest / Delete**: re-running overwrites the derived artifacts; deleting
  removes every object under `corpus/<doc-id>/` (confirmation dialog)
- See: [Document Ingestion](features/document-ingestion.md), [Corpus Library](features/corpus-library.md)

## Upload Files

- User navigates to `/upload`
- Drops or selects files in the dropzone
- Client validates file size (max 100MB) and type
- A determinate progress bar tracks the bytes leaving the browser; once they are all sent the row switches to "Storing in B2..." with an *indeterminate* sweeping bar for the server-side phase (put_object + checksums + metadata). That phase has no percentage to report — measured at 25s on a 54MB file — and a bar parked at a full 100% read as finished-but-stuck
- On success: toast notification, green checkmark, and a "View in Files" link through to the browser
- On failure: red status icon with error message
- User can clear completed uploads
- The queue lives in an app-wide provider: navigating to another page keeps the upload running, shows an "Uploading N files" indicator in the header, and keeps the duplicate-upload guard armed
- Reloading or closing mid-upload asks for confirmation first; if the upload dies anyway, the next load says which file didn't finish
- See: [File Upload](features/file-upload.md)

## Browse and Manage Files

- User navigates to `/files`
- Page loads the 100 most recent objects from the API (sorted most recent first). While it loads, the page says so on screen and escalates the wording if the wait runs long — a full bucket listing measured 2.8s-21s cold
- If that limit was hit, a notice states how many objects the bucket actually holds — the page never claims to show everything
- Files displayed in tree view with folders and type-specific icons
- Folders auto-expand on load until the *majority* of the listed files are reachable without clicking, so the page's own "click a file" instruction is always actionable. Stopping at the first visible file was not enough: one stray top-level object left the other 99 sealed in collapsed folders while the page claimed to show 100
- Clicking a file row opens its preview; the per-row actions menu (preview / download / delete) is always visible, on every viewport
- Arriving at `/files?preview=<key>` expands that file's folders and opens its preview directly. This is how the ⌘K palette and the dashboard's recent-uploads rows hand off a *specific* file; the param is consumed on arrival so it doesn't re-fire later
- **Preview**: opens dialog with image/PDF preview + metadata panel, and the file's Download / Delete actions — the advertised "click a file" path offers everything the row menu does. The loading state holds until the media paints; a failure offers "Open in a new tab". The preview URL is signed with `Content-Disposition: inline` so PDFs render in place
- **Download**: shows a pending state on the row plus a toast while the presigned URL is fetched, then starts the download via an anchor click (which, unlike a popup, still works if the click's user activation expired during a slow presign). Failures are reported; the click can never silently do nothing
- **Delete**: the confirmation dialog stays open showing "Deleting..." until the request settles, then the row disappears with the toast (optimistic cache update) and the list reconciles with the server. The dialog is held deliberately — Radix closes on action click by default, which dismissed the only pending state and left the row looking untouched while the delete was still in flight
- Empty bucket shows "No files found" with upload prompt
- See: [File Browser](features/file-browser.md)

## View Dashboard

- User navigates to `/` (home)
- Stat cards show ingestion metrics from `GET /documents/stats`: total documents,
  ingested, pending, and total chunks
- The **Write amplification** panel compares raw-source bytes vs. Docling-derived
  bytes across the corpus, with the amplification ratio and pages/tables totals —
  the headline B2 story (one raw doc fans out into parsed + chunk artifacts)
- The **Recent documents** table shows the latest documents with status and chunk
  counts; each filename links to that document's detail view
- Empty states: "No documents yet" / "No ingested documents yet" until the first
  ingest produces derived bytes
- See: [Dashboard](features/dashboard.md)

## Change Preferences

- User navigates to `/settings`
- A banner at the top states that the page is mostly a demonstration: only Theme is wired up for real, the rest showcases what a settings page can look like when you adapt the kit
- **Theme** (real): editing it and saving applies it immediately and persists it (`next-themes`), and the header's theme toggle drives the same state
- **Profile and preference fields** (demo): Display name, Bio, Default file view (Tree/List/Grid), Email me on every upload, Warn me when approaching quota + threshold. Each is labelled "Demo field", persists to `localStorage` only, and drives no behaviour — there is no account system, mailer, quota banner, activity log, or List/Grid view behind them yet
- Saving reports honestly: a success toast that separates the real theme change from the locally-stored demo values, or a warning toast if the browser blocked storage (theme still changes). It never claims a save that did not happen — the original page toasted "Settings saved" for fields that changed nothing
- Danger Zone actions are a demo — no real delete runs
- See: [Settings](features/settings.md)
