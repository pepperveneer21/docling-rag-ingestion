## Users

Developers and data engineers building RAG systems who want a reproducible,
object-storage-native document-ingestion pattern. Their context: they have a
bucket full of raw PDFs/DOCX/PPTX/HTML and need clean, structured Markdown plus
token-aware chunks — with tables and reading order preserved — to feed an
embedding or vector store. They want the parsed artifacts stored durably next to
the sources, and they'd rather run local open-source models than wire up a second
paid API.

## Product Purpose

A B2-backed document-ingestion pipeline for RAG. A developer drops a raw document
onto Backblaze B2; Docling reads it back, extracts structure, and produces clean
Markdown plus metadata-rich chunks that land back on B2 side-by-side with the
source under a matching key — turning a messy bucket into a versioned, dual-layer
corpus. B2 is both source and sink, via the S3-compatible API only, with no second
API key. The headline story is write amplification: every raw document fans out
into parsed + chunk artifacts, and the app surfaces the raw-vs-derived byte ratio.
Success = a developer can point it at their bucket, ingest a document, and get
RAG-ready artifacts they can hand to any embedding/vector stack — reproducibly.

## Brand Personality

Confident, precise, quietly professional. Voice is direct and free of hype ("Stop
wiring boilerplate and start building"). The interface should feel like a modern
developer tool — considered, calm, trustworthy — not a marketing showpiece. It is a
**neutral foundation** that others rebrand: the design carries craft through restraint,
not through a strong opinionated identity of its own.

## Anti-references

- **Generic AI/SaaS slop.** No gradient text, hero-metric templates, identical
  icon-card grids, tracked uppercase eyebrows, or decorative glassmorphism. These are
  the exact 2026 AI tells this kit exists to help builders avoid.
- **Over-branded / loud.** No heavy brand-color drenching, decorative motion, or flashy
  effects. It is scaffolding to be rebranded, not a hero page.
- **Toy / prototype feel.** No missing states, inconsistent components, or placeholder
  polish. Must read as production-grade.
- **Enterprise-drab.** No Bootstrap-era gray boxes or dense-but-lifeless admin-panel
  look. Considered, like modern dev tools (Linear, GitHub Primer, Stripe).

## Design Principles

- **Practice what you preach.** The kit itself must model the production quality it
  asks agents to produce. Slop here propagates into every project built on it.
- **Neutral foundation, easy to rebrand.** Identity lives in tokens (`globals.css`) and
  one config file. Screens are built from the shared UI kit so a rebrand is a token
  swap, not a rewrite.
- **Earned familiarity over novelty.** Use standard, trusted affordances (top bar +
  side nav, command palette, data tables). The tool disappears into the task.
- **Every state is designed.** Default, hover, focus, active, disabled, loading (skeleton),
  empty (teaches the interface), and error (says what's wrong + offers retry) — never
  half-shipped.
- **Consistency is the feature.** One button vocabulary, one form-control set, one icon
  style across every screen. Divergence is a bug.

## Accessibility & Inclusion

Target **WCAG 2.1 AA**. Body text ≥ 4.5:1, large/bold text ≥ 3:1, visible focus
indicators on every interactive element, full keyboard navigation, correct semantic
landmarks and heading order, labelled form controls, and a `prefers-reduced-motion`
alternative for every animation. Full light and dark theme parity.
