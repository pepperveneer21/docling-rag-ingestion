# Vibe Coding Starter Kit

Stop wiring boilerplate and start building. This open-source starter kit gives vibe coders and AI coding agents a production-ready foundation — a full-stack TypeScript + Python template with a pre-built dashboard UI, file upload system, and **[Backblaze B2](https://www.backblaze.com/sign-up/ai-cloud-storage?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=ai_artifacts&utm_content=b2ai-oss-start)** cloud storage already integrated. Save thousands of tokens on setup prompts, skip the "build me a dashboard from scratch" loop, and go straight to building your app's unique features.

**What you get out of the box:**
- Full-stack dashboard UI (Next.js 16 + React 19 + Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui)
- File upload with drag-and-drop, progress tracking, and metadata extraction
- File browser with preview, download, and delete
- FastAPI backend with strict layered architecture and structural tests
- Agent-optimized docs — your AI coding agent can read the repo and start contributing immediately

## What it looks like

**Dashboard** — stats, upload activity, and recent uploads at a glance:

**File browser** — tree view with preview, download, and delete:

## Agent-First Architecture

This repo is optimized for coding agents. Use the template, point your agent at it, and start building.

The structure follows the principle that **repository knowledge is the system of record**. Anything an agent can't access in-context doesn't exist — so everything it needs to reason about the codebase is versioned, co-located, and discoverable from the repo itself.

### How it works

**[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) is the single source of truth for all coding agents.** Its bounded, agent-sized entry point gives agents the repository layout, architectural invariants, commands, conventions, and pointers to deeper docs. Agent-specific files (CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md, Copilot instructions, etc.) are thin pointers back to AGENTS.md.

**Architecture is enforced mechanically, not by convention.** Layering rules, import boundaries, file size limits, and SDK containment are verified by structural tests and lints that run on every change. When rules are enforceable by code, agents follow them reliably.

**The knowledge base is structured for progressive disclosure:**

```
AGENTS.md              Single source of truth — layout, invariants, commands, conventions
ARCHITECTURE.md        System layout, layering rules, data flows
docs/
  features/            Feature docs (inputs, outputs, flows, edge cases)
  app-workflows.md     User journeys
  dev-workflows.md     Engineering workflows and testing
  SECURITY.md          Security principles
  RELIABILITY.md       Reliability expectations
  exec-plans/          Execution plans and tech debt tracker
```

### Key design decisions

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|---------------|
| Give agents a single source of truth | AGENTS.md — bounded layout, invariants, commands, conventions |
| Enforce invariants mechanically | Structural tests + ruff + ESLint verify boundaries |
| DRY documentation | Each fact lives in one place; no redundant files to drift |
| Strict layered architecture | `types -> config -> repo -> service -> runtime`, enforced by tests |
| Prefer boring, composable libraries | stdlib logging over frameworks, Pydantic over ad-hoc validation |
| Contain external SDKs | `boto3` only in `repo/` layer — verified by structural test |
| Keep files agent-sized | 300-line limit per file, enforced by test |
| Docs updated with code | Same-PR requirement prevents documentation rot |
| Structured observability | JSON logging, `/metrics` endpoint, request tracing |

This approach draws from [OpenAI's experience building with Codex](https://openai.com/index/harness-engineering/): agents work best in environments with strict boundaries, predictable structure, and progressive context disclosure.

## Quick Start

You need: Node.js >= 20, pnpm >= 9, Python >= 3.11, and a free **[Backblaze B2 account](https://www.backblaze.com/sign-up/ai-cloud-storage?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=ai_artifacts&utm_content=b2ai-oss-start)**.

### Supported local environments

Local scripts are supported on macOS, Linux, and WSL2. Native Windows is not
supported yet because the dev scripts use POSIX shell syntax and
`services/api/.venv/bin/*` paths; use WSL2 on Windows.

Cloud or sandboxed coding-agent environments also need permission for dependency
downloads during `pnpm run setup`. Running the app or Playwright E2E requires
localhost server binding for the web server on port 3000 and the API on
8000-8009, plus permission to launch the Playwright Chromium browser. If a
sandbox denies binding, `pnpm run doctor` and `scripts/pick-port.mjs` report
`EPERM`/`EACCES` as a permissions issue instead of a busy port. A host without
IPv6 (many containers) is not treated as a failure — the IPv4 probe decides.

### Start a new project

**Option 1: GitHub Template (recommended)**

Click the green **"Use this template"** button at the top of this repo, name your project, then:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourorg/my-cool-app.git
cd my-cool-app
```

**Option 2: Clone and reinitialize**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/backblaze-b2-samples/vibe-coding-starter-kit.git my-cool-app
cd my-cool-app
rm -rf .git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit from vibe-coding-starter-kit"
```

Either way you get a clean project with no upstream history — ready to push to your own repo and point your agent at it.

### Setup

**1. Run setup**

```bash
pnpm run setup
```

This copies `.env.example` to `.env` only when `.env` does not already exist,
installs workspace dependencies from `pnpm-lock.yaml`, creates
`services/api/.venv` if missing, and installs the API's committed Python 3.11
resolution from `services/api/requirements.lock`. It is safe to rerun and never
overwrites an existing `.env`.

> Use the `pnpm run` form: `setup` (like `doctor`) is a built-in pnpm command
> before pnpm 11, so bare `pnpm setup` would run pnpm's own command instead of
> this script.

**2. Add your B2 credentials**

Open `.env` in your editor and keep it visible. Then head to the [Backblaze B2 dashboard](https://secure.backblaze.com/b2_buckets.htm?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=ai_artifacts&utm_content=b2ai-oss-start) and:

1. **Create a bucket.** B2 will show two values — paste each into `.env`:
   - **Bucket Unique Name** → `B2_BUCKET_NAME`
   - **Endpoint** → `B2_ENDPOINT`
2. **Create an application key** with `Read and Write` permission. B2 will show two values — paste each into `.env`:
   - **keyID** → `B2_KEY_ID`
   - **applicationKey** → `B2_APPLICATION_KEY` *(only shown once — paste it now)*

> Want a walkthrough? See the docs for [creating a bucket](https://www.backblaze.com/docs/cloud-storage-create-and-manage-buckets) and [creating app keys](https://www.backblaze.com/docs/cloud-storage-create-and-manage-app-keys).

**3. Run it**

```bash
pnpm dev
```

That's it. Frontend at `localhost:3000`, API at `localhost:8000`. Upload a file and see it working. Interactive API docs (Swagger UI) are at `localhost:8000/docs`, with ReDoc at `/redoc`.

`pnpm dev` runs the preflight check first — it catches the common setup gotchas (wrong Node/Python version, missing venv, missing or placeholder `.env`, ports already taken) and tells you exactly how to fix each one. Run it standalone any time with `pnpm run doctor`.

## Building Your App

When you adapt this kit for a new app, keep the shared scaffolding and only swap out what's app-specific:

- **Keep** the UI kit (`apps/web/src/components/ui/` + design tokens in `globals.css` + `/design`).
- **Keep** the File Explorer (`/files`) and Upload (`/upload`) pages and their sidebar nav entries — they're the reusable B2-backed surface.
- **Adapt** the Dashboard (`/`) to your use case — replace the default stats, chart, and recent uploads with metrics that reflect what your app actually does.
- **Rebrand** by editing a single file: `apps/web/src/lib/app-config.ts` holds the app name and description (`APP_NAME`, `APP_DESCRIPTION`). Changing them there updates the page title, sidebar, and breadcrumb everywhere — no other files to touch.

Full contract and rationale: [AGENTS.md §2 — Building on This Starter Kit](AGENTS.md#2-building-on-this-starter-kit).

## Core Features

- [File Upload](docs/features/file-upload.md) — drag-and-drop upload with real-time progress
- [File Browser](docs/features/file-browser.md) — list, preview, download, delete files
- [Dashboard](docs/features/dashboard.md) — stats cards, upload chart, recent uploads
- [Metadata Extraction](docs/features/metadata-extraction.md) — image dimensions, EXIF, PDF info, checksums
- [Design System](docs/design-system.md) — tokens, primitives, AI elements, the blaze generating loader, and inline `ErrorState` / `EmptyState` patterns. Live preview at `/design`.
- Inline error handling — fetch failures surface *what's wrong* (API offline, 401, 5xx) and offer a Retry, instead of silently rendering empty state.
- Single-source config — one `.env` at the repo root powers both API and web app, validated at startup so misconfig fails fast with a readable message.
- Centralized data layer — every fetch goes through TanStack Query hooks in `apps/web/src/lib/queries.ts`; cache invalidation is one call after a mutation.
- Checked API contract — `docs/api/openapi.json` plus `pnpm contract:check` catch FastAPI/client route drift.
- Structural tests — verify layering rules, import boundaries, SDK containment, file size limits
- Structured JSON logging — every request traced with `request_id` and timing
- `/health` endpoint — B2 connectivity check
- `/metrics` endpoint — Prometheus-format counters (request count, latency, uploads)
- `/docs` + `/redoc` — auto-generated interactive API docs (toggle off in prod with `ENABLE_DOCS=false`)
- Per-IP rate limiting and magic-byte upload validation — see [SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md)

## Tech Stack

- TypeScript, Next.js 16, React 19, Tailwind v4, shadcn/ui, Recharts
- TanStack Query — caching, dedup, retry, stale-while-revalidate for every fetch
- Python 3.11+, FastAPI, boto3, Pydantic v2, Pillow, PyPDF2
- Backblaze B2 (S3-compatible object storage)
- pnpm workspaces (monorepo)

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `pnpm run setup` | Idempotently copy `.env.example` to `.env` only if missing, install workspace dependencies, create the backend venv, and install the locked API dependencies |
| `pnpm run doctor` | Preflight environment check (also runs automatically before `pnpm dev`) |
| `pnpm dev` | Start frontend + backend |
| `pnpm dev:web` | Frontend only |
| `pnpm dev:api` | Backend only |
| `pnpm contract:export` | Export deterministic FastAPI OpenAPI JSON to `docs/api/openapi.json` |
| `pnpm contract:check` | Verify the checked-in OpenAPI artifact and frontend API client route registry |
| `pnpm check:agent-docs` | Validate agent shims, command docs, CI claims, and `.env` ignore coverage |
| `pnpm verify` | Credential-free canonical non-live pre-PR suite — runs `check:agent-docs`, `verify:api`, then `verify:web` |
| `pnpm verify:api` | Backend half: API lint, API tests, structure tests |
| `pnpm verify:web` | Frontend half: web lint, web unit tests, web typecheck + build |
| `pnpm verify:full` | `pnpm run doctor`, then `pnpm verify`, then Playwright E2E; requires populated `.env`, local server/browser permission, port 3000 free, and Chromium installed |
| `pnpm build` | Build frontend |
| `pnpm lint` | Lint frontend |
| `pnpm lint:api` | Lint backend (ruff) |
| `pnpm test:web` | Run frontend unit tests (vitest) |
| `pnpm test:api` | Run backend tests |
| `pnpm check:structure` | Verify layering rules |
| `pnpm test:e2e` | Playwright E2E smoke tests (run `pnpm --filter @vibe-coding-starter-kit/web exec playwright install chromium` once first) |

Run `pnpm run setup` once before local development, and rerun it after pulling
dependency changes. It installs workspace dependencies from `pnpm-lock.yaml`
and API dependencies from `services/api/requirements.lock`. If you add a Node
dependency yourself, run `pnpm install` to refresh `pnpm-lock.yaml`; for an API
dependency, follow the reviewed refresh workflow in
[docs/dev-workflows.md](docs/dev-workflows.md#python-dependency-updates). Run
`pnpm verify` before opening a PR; it needs
`services/api/.venv` from setup. Run `pnpm verify:full` when you can start the
local app stack and browser tests: `.env` must contain real B2 values, local
server binding must be permitted, Playwright's Chromium browser must be
installed, and port 3000 must be free (or already serving this app). Playwright
waits on `http://localhost:3000`,
but `next dev` falls back to the next free port when 3000 is taken — so an
unrelated process on 3000 makes the E2E run time out. The API starts at
`localhost:8000` or the next free port chosen by `scripts/dev.sh`.

`pnpm verify` needs neither B2 credentials nor a browser. For parallel agents,
use one Git worktree per verification run as documented in [the verification
workflow](docs/dev-workflows.md#non-live-verification). That page also covers
normal timing, slow-run recovery, and installing the optional local pre-commit
hooks.
