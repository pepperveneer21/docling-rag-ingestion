# --- Middleware ordering matters for CORS-on-errors ---
# Starlette wraps middleware so the LAST one registered is the OUTERMOST. We
# need CORSMiddleware to be outermost (closest to the client) so that EVERY
# response — including the 500 produced by the timing middleware's catch-all
# for an uncaught exception — flows back out through CORS and gets an
# `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header.
#
# If CORS were registered last-but-one (inner to timing), an uncaught-exception
# 500 would be generated outside CORS and ship without that header; the browser
# would block it and the frontend would only see an opaque "network error",
# masking the real server bug. So: register the inner middleware FIRST, CORS
# LAST. Do not reorder these two without re-reading this comment.

# Rate limiting (innermost). Registered first so it sits inside timing: a 429
# is a normal response that timing records and CORS still wraps with headers.
app.add_middleware(BaseHTTPMiddleware, dispatch=ratelimit.rate_limit_middleware)

# Request ID + timing middleware. Its except-clause is the catch-all
# that turns uncaught exceptions into a typed 500 — see metrics.timing_middleware.
