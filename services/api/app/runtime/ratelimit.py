"""Per-IP fixed-window rate limiting.

Every endpoint is unauthenticated, so without throttling a client can hammer
the expensive list/stats endpoints or loop delete/download calls — a DoS and a
Backblaze transaction/egress cost-amplification vector. This is a small,
dependency-free fixed-window limiter.

Scope: in-process, per replica. That's acceptable for a starter kit; horizontal
scaling (multiple Railway replicas) needs a shared store like Redis. Documented
in docs/RELIABILITY.md.
