"""Persistence adapter for the download counter.

Persistence belongs in the repo layer (AGENTS.md §3), so the file I/O that used
to live in `service/files.py` lives here behind a small interface.

Durability caveat: this writes a JSON file at `settings.download_count_file`.
On an ephemeral filesystem (Railway without a mounted volume) the count resets
on every redeploy, and with multiple replicas each process keeps its own file
and count. For production accuracy, mount a persistent volume or swap this
adapter for a shared store (Redis/DB). See docs/RELIABILITY.md.
